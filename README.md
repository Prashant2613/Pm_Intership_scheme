🔗 Live Demo: https://ai-internship-portal.vercel.app/


📌 Problem Statement

The PM Internship Scheme aims to provide structured industry exposure to students. However, matching thousands of applicants with suitable opportunities is challenging. Current methods often cause mismatches, delays, and lack of fairness.

💡 Our Solution

We built an AI-powered matchmaking engine that pairs students with the best-fit internships using ABC ID data (academic scores, skills, certificates), along with preferences and fairness rules.

✨ Think of it like Netflix for Internships — personalized, transparent, and fair.

✅ Key Features

🔹 AI/ML Engine → Recommends internships based on skills, qualifications, and preferences.

🔹 Fairness Layer → Ensures representation from rural/aspirational districts & diverse categories.

🔹 Dashboard → Students see ranked internship matches + career guidance suggestions.

🔹 Scalability → Handles thousands of applicants with cloud-based deployment.

🔹 Transparency → Reduces bias and manual inefficiencies.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS (deployed on Vercel)

Backend (Planned/Prototype): Python (FastAPI / Flask)

AI/ML: Recommendation algorithms, fairness-aware ML models

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB (for storing profiles & matches)

Integration: ABC ID & Govt. internship APIs (future scope)

🛠️ How It Works
